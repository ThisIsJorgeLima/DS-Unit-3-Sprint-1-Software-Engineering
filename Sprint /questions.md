- What, in your opinion, is an important part of code reviews? That is, what is
  something you pay attention to when you review code, and that you appreciate
  when others do the same for your code?

- We have an awful lot of computers here, and it gets pretty confusing with
  slightly different things running on all of them. How could containers help us
  improve this situation?

Answer both of these questions (baseline ~5 sentences) here in text.


IMO what is important in part of code reviews is to keep a team all on the same page. This way one can always dictate and/or understand if he/she is up to speed. It is also good get comments and encouragement along the way.

Containers enables us to work more efficient in regards to system resources e.g, packages and modules. It helps give individuals more freedom and provide ways to build applications quickly.
